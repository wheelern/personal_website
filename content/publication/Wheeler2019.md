abstract = "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) afflicts over 60 million people worldwide and leads to severe pathological outcomes in chronic cases. The filarial nematode parasites that cause LF require both arthropod (mosquito) intermediate hosts and mammalian definitive hosts for their propagation. The invasion and migration of filarial parasites through host tissues are complex and critical to survival, yet little is known about the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate taxis in these medically important species. To better understand filarial chemosensation we employ comparative genomics, transcriptomics, reverse genetics, and chemical approaches to identify putative chemosensory receptor proteins and perturb chemosensory phenotypes in filarial nematode parasites. We find that chemoreceptor family size is correlated with the presence of environmental (extra-host) stages in nematode life cycles, and that filarial parasites contain a compact and highly-diverged chemoreceptor complement and lineage-specific ion channels that are predicted to operate downstream of chemoreceptor activation. In *Brugia malayi*, an etiological agent of LF, chemoreceptor expression patterns correspond to distinct parasite migration events across the life cycle. To interrogate the role of chemosensation in host migration, arthropod infectious stage (microfilariae) and vertebrate infectious stage (L3) Brugia parasites were incubated in nicotinamide, an agonist of the nematode transient receptor potential (TRP) channel *osm-9*. Exposure of microfilariae to nicotinamide alters intra-mosquito migration while exposure of L3s reduces chemotaxis towards host-associated cues in vitro. Nicotinamide exposure also modulates thermosensory responses in L3s, suggesting a polymodal sensory role for Brugia osm-9. Reverse genetic studies implicate both *osm-9* and the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel subunit *tax-4* in larval chemotaxis towards host serum, while these ion channel subunits do not rescue chemosensory defects in *C. elegans* *osm-9* and *tax-4* knock-out strains. Together, these data reveal genetic and functional diversification of chemosensory signaling proteins in filarial nematode parasites, and encourage a more thorough investigation of clade and parasite-specific facets of nematode sensory receptor biology."

# Biography and Research Interests

I am a post-doctoral fellow with the [Merck KGaA Global Health Institute](https://www.emdgroup.com/en/company/responsibility/our-strategy/health/mghi.html), performing research in the [Yoshino](https://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/people/yoshinot/) and [Zamanian](http://www.zamanianlab.org/) labs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my PhD in Genetics and Genomics from Iowa State University, where I was advised by [Tim Day](https://vetmed.iastate.edu/users/day).

My research has focused on several species of flatworm (*Schistosoma mansoni*) and nematode (*Brugia malayi*) parasites and their respective molluscan and mosquito vectors. These worms infect hundreds of millions of people around the globe, particularly at-risk peoples in the developing world, where they cause untold morbidity and mortality. I am interested in using genomics as a method for identifying, prioritizing, and annotating drug targets, and then using other techniques to more deeply study targets of interest. Specifically, I am interested in receptors such as G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels, which are classically prioritized as putative targets in helminth research. My research uses a number of cutting-edge techniques, including next-generation sequencing (both short read and long read), RNA interference, comparative genomics, computer vision, and microfluidics.

Currently, my main research aim is to develop stable transgenesis in *Biomphalaria glabrata*, a vector for *S. mansoni*, and its associated immortalized cell line, Bge. A reproducbile technique for transgenesis in this organism will not only open new research opportunities, but it will enable the consideration of new vector control approaches that utilize gene drives.

This website includes a link to my current CV, but it can also be used as a digital (and more aestethically pleasing) replacement. It includes a list of selected publications, a description of ongoing projects, a sample of past teaching, and relevant contact information. Also, this is a work in progress and will be updated as necessary, so if a page is empty, hopefully it won't stay that way!
